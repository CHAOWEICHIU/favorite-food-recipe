## About me

> :fire: Full Stack Web Developer

I am a freelance full-stack web developer, and I get so 
excited whenever there is a chance that I can challenge
myself and become a better software developer.


> :fire: Test Nerd

Few months age, I have exposed to TDD(test-driven development) way
of writing a software. Since then, I have fallen in love with that.
I was inspired by [MPJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBDa5dqrl8)
and [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqAaMVoKz1c)
